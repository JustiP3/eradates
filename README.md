TODO LIST

-We can now add dates to the server from the admin menu. We need to be able to assocate a date with an era.

- In YelpResult, add option to view details about a business (location, etc.)

- Add form to testcomponent for text input and safe/unsafe

- Add option to select a location that is not current location

- Connect to an express server

- Better Solution to storing date-options for each era than a hard-coded array. Connect to a database.

- Production Solution to CORS
