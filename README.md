TODO LIST

- "View All Dates" button currently displays the results from /api/eras which does not account for the dates that are not yet associated with an era.
  -Previously "View All Dates" displayed the results from /api/datetypes which only displayed datetypes and not the assocated eras.

-We can now add dates to the server from the admin menu. We need to be able to assocate a date with an era.

- In YelpResult, add option to view details about a business (location, etc.)

- Add option to select a location that is not current location

- Connect to an express server

- Better Solution to storing date-options for each era than a hard-coded array. Connect to a database.

- Production Solution to CORS
